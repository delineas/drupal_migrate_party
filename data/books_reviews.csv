1973874709,"Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes Unabridged 1605 Original Version",Penny,Johnson,"Two modern translations of Don Quixote, those by Raffel (the newer Norton Critical Edition) and Grossman (the perennial bestseller), seem to dominate the market right now. I suspect I am not alone in being annoyed by Raffel's overzealous attempts to modernize the book and Grossman's stubborn refusal to use common words whenever possible. If you are looking for a compromise between the two, this is an excellent candidate."
B01ED4MJSY,"War and Peace",Greg,Polansky,"Approaching War and Peace feels like a monumental task. Sitting down and reading it is not for the faint of heart. The story is engrossing and will consume you. It took me about four weeks to finish it because it's not the kind of book that one can read straight through. One puts it down to think about it, coming back after one has digested what has one read."
